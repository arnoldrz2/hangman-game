			This game of Hangman contains titles of many classic video games. Titles will only include the main title of the game and don't include any numbers. For example: Something like, "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" wouldn't be included, but the main title "Call of Duty" could be included.

			Hint: "Classic Video Games" could refer to any video game that released before the year 2000.
