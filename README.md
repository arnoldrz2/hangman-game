This is a "Classic Video Games" themed game of Hangman. The rules of the game are standard hangman rules. The user tries to guess the word by entering letters. Correct letters will fill into the black. Incorrect letters will cause the user to lose lives (they start off with 10 lives). Letters that have been guessed will load into the "Letters Already Guessed" box. When the player wins a game, the win counter will increase (as long as the window isn't refreshed).
